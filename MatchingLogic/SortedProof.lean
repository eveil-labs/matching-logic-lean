The many-sorted proof system, and the non-derivability half of Proposition 30.
arXiv:2608.13306v1, Section 8.

  "Say that a sort s FEEDS a sort t if s = t or some symbol has an argument of
   sort s and result sort t. Write s ⇒ t for the reflexive transitive closure.
   In this signature no symbol has an argument of sort a, so a ⇒ t holds only
   for t = a.

   Every rule of Figure 2 has premises whose sorts feed the sort of its
   conclusion. Modus ponens and the quantifier rules are sort-preserving, and
   framing puts a pattern of sort s into one argument position of a symbol, so
   its conclusion has that symbol's result sort t, and such a symbol has an
   argument of sort s. So if the conclusion of a rule has sort t ≠ a, then no
   premise of it has sort a.

   By induction on derivations, every line whose sort is not a is derivable from
   the axioms alone. A hypothesis line has sort a and is excluded, an axiom line
   needs nothing, and a rule with conclusion of sort t ≠ a has, by the previous
   paragraph, no premise of sort a. The induction hypothesis therefore applies to
   all of its premises. Since φ has sort c, from Γ ⊢ φ we would get ⊢ φ and hence
   ⊨ φ by (S). But φ is not valid."

DESIGN RULINGS:

* The many-sorted Figure 2 is written out in full rather than abstracted behind
  a "sort-feeding" hypothesis. The paper's argument is that Figure 2 HAS that
  property; assuming it instead would prove a weaker and much less interesting
  statement.
* Many-sorted soundness is a HYPOTHESIS, as in the paper, which cites it to
  [3, Thm. 13] rather than proving it: "Soundness is the implication from Γ⊢φ to
  Γ⊨φ and is proved in [3, Thm. 13]. Input (S) of Section 2 is its one-sorted
  case." Our one-sorted `soundness` is proved; this is its many-sorted analogue
  and is not.
* Γ is taken homogeneous at one sort. Proposition 30's Γ is a singleton of
  sort `a`, and the induction below is stated in terms of that sort.

/-! ### Many-sorted soundness, assumed as the paper does -/

/-- `(S)` at many sorts.  The paper cites this to [3, Thm. 13] rather than
proving it; our one-sorted `soundness` is proved, this is not.

NARROWER THAN THE PAPER, deliberately: this quantifies only over HOMOGENEOUS
theories, whereas the paper's many-sorted theories may mix sorts. That is
exactly sufficient for Proposition 30, whose `Γ` is a singleton at sort `a`, and
it keeps the induction below stated in terms of a single `sΓ`. An audit flagged
the narrowing, so it is recorded here rather than silent. -/

/-- **Proposition 30, third claim.**  `Γ ⊬ φ`.

`φ` has sort `c`, and `a` feeds only `a`, so any derivation of `φ` from `Γ`
would be a derivation from no hypotheses; soundness would then make `φ` valid,
and it is not — take `M_b = {r, s}` with `g_M(r) ≠ g_M(s)`. -/

/-- **Corollary 31**, at the Proposition 30 data.

The paper states Corollary 31 in general: *"There is no translation from
many-sorted definedness-free matching logic into any one-sorted definedness-free
matching logic that preserves global consequence and reflects derivability."*
Its proof is one line — preservation, then Corollary 15 in the target, then
reflection would give `Γ ⊢ φ`.

What is stated here is the **counterexample instance**, not the general
statement: there is no target signature and pair of translations that works for
the Proposition 30 data. A full rendering would define a translation on the
whole source language and state preservation and reflection generally; this is
the lemma that instance argument needs, and the general form is future work.

Three hypotheses are load-bearing and were all missing from a first draft of
this statement, which an audit showed to be concretely FALSE without them:

* `hxy : x ≠ y` — without it `φ3` collapses to a derivable pattern, and the
  existential body is inhabited;
* `StrongLocalCompleteness T Var` — (L) must hold **in the target**, since the
  paper's proof applies Corollary 15 there. A first draft required it of an
  unrelated fixed signature;
* closedness of the translated patterns, which `global_completeness` requires.
