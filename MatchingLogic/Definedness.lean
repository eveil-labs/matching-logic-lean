Corollary 16 — conservativity of definedness. arXiv:2608.13306v1, Section 5.

  "**Corollary 16 (conservativity of definedness).** If Γ and φ are
   definedness-free, then Γ ∪ {⌈x⌉} ⊢ φ implies Γ ⊢ φ.

   *Proof.* Soundness in the enriched signature gives Γ ∪ {⌈x⌉} ⊨ φ (Figure 2 is
   sound for every signature). Every definedness-free M ⊨ Γ expands to a model of
   Γ ∪ {⌈x⌉}, so M ⊨ φ. Hence Γ ⊨ φ, and Corollary 15 applies."

Adding definedness to the language cannot prove new definedness-free theorems.
This is the first result here that DEPENDS on Corollary 15, so it only became
reachable once the proof-theoretic half landed.

DESIGN RULINGS:

* The enriched signature is `defSig S`, whose symbols are `Option S.Sym` with
  `none` the unary definedness symbol. `emb` embeds definedness-free patterns
  into it. Nothing in `Core.lean` changes; the base development stays
  definedness-free, as the paper's whole subject requires.
* Definedness is not a new semantic clause. It is an ordinary symbol whose
  interpretation is forced by the axiom `⌈x⌉`: interpreting it as constantly
  `univ` on singletons makes the pointwise extension give `univ` on nonempty
  arguments and `∅` on empty ones, which is exactly `ρ(⌈φ⌉)` of Section 2.
* (L) stays a hypothesis, inherited from Corollary 15. (S) does not: `soundness`
  is a theorem, and it holds at every signature, `defSig S` included.

holds at `defSig S` as at any signature.  (L) remains a hypothesis, inherited
