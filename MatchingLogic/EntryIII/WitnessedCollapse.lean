/-- **The failure is not stable under α-renaming.**

`∃0. var 0` has no fresh witness above: the only variable naming the witnessing
element is `0`, and `0` occurs in the body, so freshness over `allVars` rules it
out.  Its α-variant `∃1. var 1` is a different raw pattern with the same
meaning, and for it the name `0` *is* fresh — so a fresh witness exists.

This locates ONE cause of the phenomenon: on raw named syntax the choice of
bound name can exhaust the supply of usable witnesses, and choosing another
representative of the same α-class restores it.

It does NOT show that α is the whole story, and an earlier version of this
docstring said it was.  `AlphaFreshWitnessed.lean` refutes that: there is an MCS
that is `Witnessed` and fails the α-RELAXED condition too, so quotienting by α
would not remove the need for the stronger invariant.  What does remove it is an
infinite supply of usable witnesses — see `WitnessSupply.lean`. -/
