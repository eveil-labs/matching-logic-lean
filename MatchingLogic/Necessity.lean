Desk-authored adversarial check on Lemma 9 (2026-08-25).

A mechanized lemma is worth only what it forbids.  `locality` carries a
backward-closure hypothesis; if the conclusion held without it, our encoding of
the pointwise extension would be too weak and the mechanization would be
vacuous where it matters.  This file exhibits a model, a set `C` that is NOT
backward closed, and two valuations satisfying `AgreeOn C` whose denotations
differ on `C`.  So the hypothesis is load-bearing.

The example is the smallest one that works: `M \ C` must have two points, since
`AgreeOn` forces the two valuations to agree whenever their common value lies
in `C`, and a one-point complement leaves them equal.

Since `0 ∈ σ_M(1)`, the backward step of Definition 2 runs from the output to the
argument: `0 ⇝ 1`.  So backward closure of `{0}` would force `1 ∈ {0}`. -/

/-! The countermodel is stated for an arbitrary variable type, then instantiated
both at `Unit` and at `ℕ`.  The `ℕ` instance is the paper's setting, where the
element variables are countably infinite, so this refutes the hypothesis-free
statement in the paper's own domain and not merely in a degenerate one. -/
