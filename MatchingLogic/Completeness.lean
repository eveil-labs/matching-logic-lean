Theorem 14 and Corollary 15 — arXiv:2608.13306v1, Sections 4 and 5.

Corollary 15 is the paper's main positive result and the object of its
mechanization challenge. Entry point (ii) is Corollary 15 with (L) and (S)
assumed; entry point (iii) discharges (L) as well.

(L) and (S) are `Prop` hypotheses of these theorems, never Lean axioms, so the
dependence stays visible in the statement and `#print axioms` stays meaningful.

Statements pinned before any proof was attempted.
