Corollary 12 and Theorem 13 of arXiv:2608.13306v1, Sections 4-5.

Theorem 13 is the semantic half of global completeness: it is where Lemma 8
supplies `C ⊆ ⟦Γ⟧` and the double cover of Definition 10 turns a *local*
countermodel into a *global* one.

/-- **Corollary 12.**  For closed `ψ`, `⟦ψ⟧_N = (⟦ψ⟧_M ∩ C) × {0,1}`.
The `∩ C` and the `× {0,1}` are both absorbed by the carrier `↥C × Bool`: the
statement says a point of `N` lies in `⟦ψ⟧_N` exactly when its underlying
point of `C` lies in `⟦ψ⟧_M`, whichever copy it is in. -/

/-- **Corollary 12**, second half: `N ⊨ ψ` iff `C ⊆ ⟦ψ⟧_M`.

Note that `star` and `hstar` appear nowhere in the statement, only in the proof
(Lemma 11 consumes them).  They are not vestigial: requiring a point outside `C`
is how this theorem carries Definition 10's standing assumption `C ≠ M`.  A
caller must exhibit one, so Corollary 12 does NOT apply when `C = M` -- which is
exactly why Theorem 13 handles that case separately. -/

/-- **Theorem 13 (semantic localization).**  `Γ ⊨ φ ⟺ Δ_Γ ⊨loc φ`.

`(⇐)` is Lemma 7.  `(⇒)` is contrapositive: a local countermodel gives a point
`w` with `w ∈ ⟦Δ_Γ⟧` and `w ∉ ⟦φ⟧`; take `C := ⇝*[w]`, which is backward
closed, contains `w`, and satisfies `C ⊆ ⟦Γ⟧` by Lemma 8.  If `C = M` we are
done; otherwise the double cover `N` of Definition 10 satisfies `Γ` and refutes
`φ`, by Corollary 12. -/
